C I chose FORTRAN as the second project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/FireDiamondSuite) as FORTRAN was a language I decided to use alongside Forth, for software diversity reasons, and because Fortran goes well with the field of chemistry. I wanted to choose 4 notable languages for this project, this was the second in the order of 4 (shuffled) It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
